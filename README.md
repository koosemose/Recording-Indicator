Recording Indicator

Overlay for Playclaw 5 Plus.

This overlay displays a circle that changes color depending on recording status, and can optionally be hidden when not recording. 

It is primarily meant as a simple way to show very clearly rather or not you are actively recording, for those of us who are oblivious to simple things like changing color of FPS overlay.
